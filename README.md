## Furgo App clone by Gerard Cabrerizo 
This is a simple clone of the furgo app built using: 

* react-native
* redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, redux-logger
* react-navigation
* react-native-video 
* react-native-navigation-actions*

And for the backend: 

* aws-amplify, aws-amplify-react-native
* amazon cognito 

Bootrsapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).



* ##react-native-navigation-actions:  
Used to be able to navigate within a Redux action without having to integrate react-navigation and redux together.
